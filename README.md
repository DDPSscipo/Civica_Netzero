## Introduction

April 2024 broke another record in the climate change arena. Surpassing the 1991-2020 average for the month, April 2024 was reportedly the hottest April in the last thirty years, reaching over 15°C (Mooney et al., 2024). Over the past decades citizens and decision makers have been forced to confront the visible effects of climate change on communities all around the globe. With climate change, we refer to the long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns caused by anthropogenic means. Since the Industrial Revolution, the exponential increase in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions has led to the trapping of the sun’s heat in the atmosphere, generating a +2°C rise compared to pre-industrial levels. Consequences of this increase in temperatures range from the melting of arctic ice to a growth in weather-related catastrophes like floods, storms and droughts. To tackle the effects of climate change, governments globally have started putting forward legislation and policies at the local and international levels. From the United Nations Framework Conference on Climate Change (UNFCCC) to the Kyoto Protocol to the Paris Agreement, curbing GHG emissions seems to be at the top of the climate agenda. In this perspective, we were interested in analyzing the best practices in the realm of climate policies. Notably, the UK’s 2021 Net Zero Strategy represents the first piece of legislation by a major economy to commit to reaching net zero GHG emissions by 2050. Passed by a conservative government, led by then-Prime Minister Theresa May, the policy is innovative in its sectoral approach, prioritizing strategic sectors like transport, agriculture, and industry at large. Furthermore, the carbon pricing mechanisms would aim to foster energy efficiency measures and attract investments on low-carbon technologies. Due to its ambitiousness, the Strategy has attracted a lot of media and public attention, at times critical. For this reason, investigating how the discourse developed around it on social media and in a leading UK news outlet – namely on Twitter (now X) and The Guardian –  could provide us an insightful perspective on the response towards the climate policies we are seeing ramp up all around the world. We are going to lead our investigation by addressing **_two main research questions:_**

**RQ1:** What are the topics of focus in The Guardian’s coverage and in the public discourse on Twitter, and to what extent are these topics reflected across one another?

**RQ2:** How has traditional media coverage by The Guardian and public discourse on Twitter evolved around the UK’s Net Zero policy? 

<a name="ques"></a>
### Hypotheses
To develop hypotheses, our team conducted an initial scan of the discourse on Twitter as well as reviewed how The Guardian framed its articles covering the Net Zero Strategy. We observed a surprising amount of Tweets relating Net Zero to broader socio-political critiques. In particular, the term seemed to be deployed in a “culture wars” context by accounts expressing right-wing views, such as opposition to both immigration and environmental protections.

As a result, we derived three hypotheses to understand the Twitter discourse and The Guardian coverage of Net Zero in the UK:

**Hypothesis 1:** Traditional media coverage by The Guardian on Net Zero mirrors an overall increase in social media interest on Twitter, whilst they may differ in focus.

**Hypothesis 2:** Net Zero has often been mobilized on social media in the context of bipartisan culture wars.

**Hypothesis 3:** There is a mutual correlation between the introduction and implementation of the Net Zero Strategy and an increased public interest in the “net zero” concept over the last several years.

## Overview: The Implementation of Net Zero

### The Net Zero Strategy in the UK
The journey towards achieving net zero emissions has become a global imperative as nations grapple with the challenges posed by climate change. The Net Zero commitment embraced by several nations is a pledge aimed at minimizing carbon emissions to a level where only a minimal amount of residual emissions remains, which can either be safely absorbed by the environment or captured through the use of green technologies(UN). The Net Zero policy adopted by the UK aims to reduce carbon emissions by 50% and 75% by 2032 and 2037, respectively, and to reach net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 (Department of Energy Security & Net Zero, 2023). In order to reach net zero by 2050, the UK Government has implemented a series of policies outlined in two strategy documents: the original Net Zero Strategy: Build Back Greener (2021) and Powering Up Britain: Net Zero Growth Plan (2023) (Burnett, Edwards, Watson, 2023).

In October 2021, the UK government published Net Zero Strategy: Build Back Greener. The UK seeks to reduce its current levels of emissions through five-year carbon budgets outlined in the Climate Change Act. The Climate Change Act, enacted in 2008, serves to achieve and lower carbon emissions targets by 2050. It establishes a framework for carbon budgeting and establishes a committee to aid in achieving this objective (UK Legislation, 2008). This document presents policies and proposals to measure and maintain progress towards upcoming carbon budgets, aligning with the ambitious visions for a decarbonized economy by 2050.

In June 2022, the environmental organizations Friends of the Earth, ClientEarth, Good Law Project, as well as environmental campaigner Jo Wheatley, took the UK government to court over its 2021 Net Zero strategy. The groups argued that the government’s policies would not reduce emissions enough to meet the carbon budgets outlined in the Climate Change Act of 2008. In July, the UK High Court of Justice handed down its judgment. The ruling deemed the government’s initial plan to be inadequate and ordered the government to outline exactly how its net zero policies would achieve emissions targets, and to publish a revised Net Zero strategy (Client Earth, 2022; Gayle, 2022).

In March 2023, following the Court’s decision, the UK government published Powering Up Britain: Net Zero Growth Plan, a comprehensive strategy aimed at achieving net zero emissions while promoting economic growth. It addresses recommendations from an independent review of Net Zero. The revised plan focuses on driving investment into green industries like offshore wind, carbon capture, and nuclear energy (Department for Energy Security & Net Zero, 2023).
Our interest in examining the UK’s Net Zero policy within a specific timeframe stems from its evolving significance in both traditional media and online discourses.

## Literature Review

### Social media discourse and agenda setting
The importance of mass media (radio, television, printed press) in shaping political discourse has been largely discussed. The concept of the agenda setting function of mass media, as proposed by McCombs and Shaw (1971) and Gilardi et al. (2022), refers to the traditional media's power to determine the subjects discussed politically, that is to say, to set the political agenda. As political scientist Bernard C. Cohen explains, the press “‘may not be successful much of the time in telling people what to think, but it is stunningly successful in telling its readers what to think about’” (Cohen cited in McCombs & Shaw, 1971, p. 177).

The spread of the Internet and the popularity of social media has revolutionized the sources through which the public remains informed about political information. Social media has also made it possible to interact directly with journalists, politicians, and other political actors (Chu & Fletcher, 2014). Gilardi et. al (2022) found that social media has changed political agenda setting dynamics in three main ways. Firstly, social media has emerged as a meaningful channel for political communication. Secondly, social media broadens the range and diversity of actors who can influence the agenda. Thirdly, social media can be used by political actors to attract traditional media attention, and gain a wider audience.

Chu & Fletcher (2014) for instance, found evidence of agenda setting led by Twitter (now X) activity. In one example, Canadian news networks were found to have given more coverage to the topic of the federal long-gun registry the day after a peak in activity related to the subject on social media. The influence of Twitter and traditional mass media can go both ways, and greatly varies according to the topic. It is also important to keep in mind that Twitter has a particular type of audience (mostly highly educated, mainly young users).

## Methodology 

### Data collection
Our broad approach to data collection included gathering data for two sources before delving into our analysis. Specifically, we collected data in the form of Tweets from the social media platform Twitter and in the form of articles from The Guardian’s API. There were two three-month periods of interest – September 1 through November 30, 2021, and September 1 to November 30, 2023 – selected to investigate whether and how the discourse and news coverage may have changed over time. We decided to start with the month immediately before and after the Net Zero policy’s implementation in October 2021 and then repeated the same three selected months two years later in 2023. 

For Twitter, we scraped Tweets by month that included the keywords “net zero” and “uk” utilizing the Firefox extensions Zeeschuimer and FoxScroller. We limited captured Tweets to being written in English and with a minimum of one like. The keyword search is included below (with the initial month of September 2021 for demonstrative purposes): 

_("net zero" OR "netzero") AND "uk" min_faves:1 lang:en until:2021-09-30 since:2021-09-01_

We utilized the VPN Mullvad and set the location to London, England. In total, we collected 15,998 Tweets over the two three-month periods in 2021 and 2023, with 8,656 Tweets during the 2021 period and 7,342 during the 2023 period. During data collection, we encountered an error while scraping Twitter data – Tweets from the final date of each month during both periods (September 30, 2021; October 31, 2021; November 30, 2021; September 30, 2023; October 31, 2023; and November 30, 2023) were not collected by Zeeschuimer despite search terms requesting data through the end of the month. This omission is thus one important limitation that we will discuss in greater depth in the Limitations section of the report. We were unable to add the missing dates’ Tweets into our dataset for analysis because of time constraints and for the fact that various team members had already started their separate analyses. 

We utilized The Guardian’s API to gather all news pieces concerning Net Zero from September 2021, to February 2024, amassing over 1,000 articles. For the purpose of our analyses, we focused on articles from September 2021 through November 2021 and September 2023 through November 2023. Subsequently, we manually sifted through this dataset to isolate articles specifically addressing the implementation of Net Zero in the UK, leaving 156 articles for the entire 2021-2024 period. (With respect to the two periods of interest, we collected 26 articles for September - November 2021, and 36 during the same window in 2023.) Additionally, keyword filters such as "net zero" and "UK" were applied to aid in this filtering process, recognizing that the term "Net Zero'' is not exclusive to the UK, as Australia’s carbon reduction initiatives utilize the same language.

### Data cleaning
We used Python to clean the Twitter data. For the accuracy and convenience of our analysis, we removed potentially repetitive data points, and handpicked useful fields (user ID, username, creation date, content, hashtags, etc.) from the original ndjson data to include in the csv format. We also generated nodes and edges data for network analysis with software Gephi.

### Approach to data analysis
To conduct the descriptive analysis for the data from Twitter and The Guardian, our team explored four different methods of data analysis: descriptive analysis and sentiment analysis for both Twitter and The Guardian datasets, and topic modeling and network analysis utilizing Twitter data. Further details on these approaches are included in the Results and Discussion section.

We used Python for our code, which was developed and aided by various online resources and examples, including ChatGPT. We also used Gephi for data visualization.

## Results and Discussion
<a name="twitter"></a>
### Descriptive analysis: Twitter 
We produced two time-series graphs to explore the number of Tweets throughout the 2021 and 2023 time periods.

![Figure 1](https://github.com/DDPSscipo/Civica_Netzero/assets/169551434/95d16e47-9dbe-4440-9daf-4d9f6ff8f947)

Figure 1: Number of Tweets Mentioning “Net Zero” Over Time, 09/01/2021-11/30/2021 

In the 2021 graph (Figure 1), we observe a large increase in the number of Tweets on October 19, 2021. At 538 Tweets, this date received the highest recorded number of Tweets during the 2021 period. This is not surprising given that October 19 was the date of Net Zero’s official implementation in the UK. In the following weeks, there were more dramatic spikes in Tweets and an overall higher number of Tweets compared to before the policy’s implementation. The second highest recorded number of Tweets was 426 on November 3, 2021, which happened to be the date the UK government announced its goal to become the “first ever net zero aligned global financial centre” at the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP 26) (Plummer, R. & Timmins, B.).

Below are sample Tweets from the 2021 period which illustrate two accounts’ contributions to the discourse. Image 1 is the Tweet that garnered the most likes during the entire captured period in 2021. Topics covered in the Twitter discourse will be explored in-depth in the later Topic Modeling and Network Analysis sections.

Image 2: Tweet about “Net Zero” from 2021 dataset

Turning to the 2023 graph (Figure 2), we see fairly consistent discourse across the three months, with the exception of a major spike on September 20, 2023. Throughout the captured period in 2023, the number of daily Tweets containing “net zero” and “uk” was often fewer than 100 per day. On September 20, 2023, there were 1080 Tweets, which is just over two times greater than the highest number of Tweets in the 2021 period (538 Tweets). This date featured a prominent speech by UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak. He announced changes to the Net Zero policy, specifically delays to certain climate targets on cars, boilers, and insulation, though Sunak declared that “he still wishes to meet the legally binding 2025 target” (Horton, 2023).

### Descriptive analysis: The Guardian

![Figure 3](https://github.com/DDPSscipo/Civica_Netzero/assets/169551434/9fb59347-5e3c-4904-bd4e-9bd59113d1cd)

Figure 3: Number of Guardian Articles About “Net-Zero” published from 01/09/2021 - 30/11/2021

On October 19, _The Guardian_ published three articles, as seen in Figure 3. Beforehand, we see that on most days there were zero articles pertaining to Net Zero with respect to the UK. Shortly after the policy’s implementation, the Guardian published three opinion pieces on October 26 regarding the feasibility of implementation and whether the UK will meet their net zero emissions targets. 


![Figure 4](https://github.com/DDPSscipo/Civica_Netzero/assets/169551434/5efce5d3-6511-4112-bdf3-4a3b12582178)

Figure 4: Number of Guardian Articles About “Net-Zero” published from 01/09/2023 - 30/11/2023

On September 20, 2023, there were eight articles published by The Guardian regarding Net Zero, which was the highest number throughout both the 2021 and 2023 periods.

### _Descriptive analysis across two sources_

![Figure 5](https://github.com/DDPSscipo/Civica_Netzero/assets/169551434/a1a6ad15-bb46-49d8-9eb0-3b5ea4767eec)

Figure 5: Comparison of Tweets and The Guardian Articles Mentioning “Net Zero” Over Time, (01/09/2021 - 30/11/2021)


![Figure 6](https://github.com/DDPSscipo/Civica_Netzero/assets/169551434/16ac9c93-81ce-419f-9c83-33c6ee017954)

Figure 6: Comparison of Tweets and The Guardian Articles Mentioning “Net Zero” Over Time, (01/09/2023 - 30/11/2023)

Across Twitter and in _The Guardian’s_ coverage, there were similar spikes in discourse. The implementation of Net Zero in 2021 was followed by increased conversation on Twitter about the policy. Similarly, The Guardian published several articles about the policy and continued with consistent and more frequent publication as compared to its coverage prior to October 19, 2021. Two years later, the Twitter discourse and _The Guardian_ coverage once again mirrored one another after the Prime Minister’s speech in which he announced rolling back certain climate targets for Net Zero. It makes sense that in response to a major shift in the policy both the public and the press expressed their thoughts with greater frequency in 2023. We can observe the changes in frequency of these discussions/coverage across the two data sources mapped in Figures 5 and 6. In later topic modeling and network analyses, we will unpack the topics connected to Net Zero (on Twitter only), which may aid in our understanding of how the conversation shifted over time.

This overlay graph can be a helpful tool for comparison purposes, demonstrating that overall coverage increased over time. However, we cannot necessarily extrapolate strong conclusions from _The Guardian_ graphical “spikes” for days in which only one article was published in this normalized illustration, especially if we look at those individual dates in isolation as opposed to within the broader timeline.

With respect to Hypothesis 1, there does seem to be mirroring on Twitter and with coverage by _The Guardian_ during both time periods, particularly surrounding significant events. The spikes across the two data sources increase and cluster around dates with major activity – for example, around the implementation of the Net Zero policy in 2021 and Sunak’s speech introducing delays on climate targets in 2023. On Twitter, there were roughly 1,300 more Tweets during the 2021 period compared to in 2023, while in _The Guardian_ there were 26 articles focused on Net Zero in the 2021 period and 36 in 2023. These numbers might suggest that Twitter users were more interested in discussing Net Zero earlier on and immediately after its implementation. Thus, in response to Hypothesis 1, while we can say there was a broad interest in Net Zero on social media and in the news, the two data sources do not mirror one another in terms of increased interest because there was more engagement on social media in 2021 (relative to social media engagement in 2023) and more coverage by The Guardian in 2023 compared to its 2021 coverage. Similarly, with respect to Hypothesis 3 – which we will continue to answer in later analysis sections – we can say that the levels of engagement on Twitter in 2021 demonstrate immediate interest and discussion. The co-occurrence of Net Zero’s implementation and COP26 could explain why engagement in 2021 was higher than in 2023. These events likely also explain the larger and more dramatic and continued fluctuations after the initial 2021 spike representing the policy’s implementation compared to changes following the single major spike in 2023. This could suggest that following the introduction of Net Zero in the UK, there was perhaps not just a heightened sense of interest (Hypothesis 1) but that interest was sustained and discussed more often and for longer during that short-term 2021 period, resulting in more dramatic fluctuations as Twitter users and The Guardian coverage continued to mention the policy. The 2023 data for both Twitter and _The Guardian_ show altogether tighter time-series graphs with fewer fluctuations. This trend can be attributed to the rollback of multiple provisions outlined in the UK government’s Net Zero policy in 2023. _The Guardian _extensively covered these developments, thereby supporting Hypothesis 1 of our study, which contends that traditional media coverage leads to heightened responses on Twitter.

### Sentiment analysis: Twitter 

In order to test Hypothesis 2, we used sentiment analysis in an attempt to determine whether people discussed Net Zero on Twitter in a positive, negative, or neutral manner. We utilized the RoBERTa-base model, which was trained on ~124 million Tweets from 2018 to 2021, and fine tuned with the TweetEval benchmark. For each Tweet, the model assigns a negative, neutral, and positive score, from 0 to 1.

We computed the mean of the Tweets’ scores per week for both 2021 and 2023 to see if there was an evolution in the sentiments shown. Our results showed consistently a very high neutral score (consistently over 0.8) compared to the positive and negative scores (under 0.2). 


![Figures 7   8](https://github.com/DDPSscipo/Civica_Netzero/assets/169551434/bcb30945-faa2-4c9d-b2b4-f99b58193488)

Figures 7 & 8: Overview of sentiment analysis scores for 2021 and 2023 Tweets

We then classified the Tweets as positive, negative or neutral according to the highest scoring category. We obtained the following results across the two different time periods:

Number of Tweets Classified by Sentiment in 2021:
Neutral     8637
Positive       1

Number of Tweets Classified by Sentiment in 2023:
Neutral     7335
Negative       6
Positive       1

Both in 2021 and 2023, most of the Tweets were classified as neutral. The high volume of neutral Tweets could indicate that the dataset predominantly covers topics that are either informational or discussed in a manner that does not involve emotional language. Some users may have discussed Net Zero in a measured, factual tone (which could have been scored more accurately as neutral), but there are numerous examples (both anecdotally and seen in the topic modeling and network analyses) of people using subtle, coded, or sarcastic language that the model failed to pick up. Further, these results likely indicate that the RoBERTa model is not tailored for Tweets that discuss topics in a heightened political and/or coded manner, and thus it falls short when analyzing the Tweets of our database. Sentiment analysis remains thus limited for our Twitter analysis and does not allow us to make conclusions in response to our research questions or hypotheses. 

<a name="senguar"></a>
### _Sentiment analysis: The Guardian_ 
We used VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) to conduct a sentiment analysis for all the articles published by The Guardian regarding Net Zero from September 2021 through February 2024. VADER utilizes a pre-built dictionary containing words and their associated sentiment score, with each word being assigned a polarity (positive, negative or neutral) and an intensity score. We chose VADER because it takes into account punctuation and capitalization of words along with booster words which can affect the positive or negative polarity of adjacent words.  We used VADER to analyze the headlines of The Guardian due to the fact that VADER excels at analyzing short pieces of text and also that it is capable of interpreting informal language and punctuations, taking into account capitalization or exclamation marks which can be important indicators of sentiments in headlines and VADER accounts for these factors. Hence making it a better choice as compared to RoBERTa, which is more ideal towards contextual information in longer texts.

We collected over 1000 articles on the topic of net zero from September 2021 till February 2024. After filtering for the keywords ‘net zero’ and ‘UK’, we identified 156 relevant articles published by The Guardian. Consequently,  we conducted a sentiment analysis on the entire dataset, including articles outside the specified time period (September 2021 to November 2021 & September 2023 to November 2023), and obtained the following results:

![Table 1](https://github.com/DDPSscipo/Civica_Netzero/assets/169551434/ebc6e6d8-b3f6-41b7-89f1-933791b05453)


For all articles published between September 1, 2021, through November 30, 2021, we obtained the following results:


![Table 2](https://github.com/DDPSscipo/Civica_Netzero/assets/169551434/22511ed4-7d39-485c-9c8f-15996db2a136)

Image 6: Article published by _The Guardian_ on 20/10/2021


For all articles published between September 1, 2023, through November 30, 2023, we obtained the following results:


![Table 3](https://github.com/DDPSscipo/Civica_Netzero/assets/169551434/e704d3df-0c02-44b6-a0f8-4edf733d6690)


Overall, the majority of _The Guardian’s_ articles on Net Zero were negative, while the numbers of positive and negative articles were more comparable. This trend is significant in light of the specific timeframes examined. In 2021, during the initial introduction of Net Zero policies by the UK government, there was considerable skepticism regarding the feasibility and effectiveness. In contrast, by 2023, the discourse has shifted due to Prime Minister Rishi Sunak’s rollback on Net Zero commitments and legal case against the UK government alleging non-compliance with the Climate Change Act. This evolving context highlights the changing public and media perceptions of the UK’s Net Zero policies over time.

### Topic modeling 
As we scraped the data from Twitter using Zeeschuimer, we noticed recurrent patterns in the Tweets. In line with previous literature, we noticed that the topic of Net Zero was often mobilized in contexts that are not strictly related to environmental policies. Indeed, the content of some of the Tweets – in our dataset contained in the “full_text” column – is heavily politicized and strongly positioned at the limits of the partisan spectrum. For instance, “net zero” was at times associated with broader phenomena like woke vs. anti-woke culture, anti-vax movements, and xenophobia. These first remarks are what encouraged us to formulate Hypothesis 2, regarding “bipartisan culture wars” on social media. In order to address this issue, we deemed it useful to rely on topic modeling techniques. Topic modeling is a form of unsupervised ML algorithm that  looks for “topics” in data – in our case, our Twitter dataset. The goal is for the algorithm to form topics which group commonly co-occurring words. From this perspective, a topic is simply a list of words that are often used in the same context. Each topic will display a “ranking” of words according to their score (based on their importance) in the topic. We opted for the BERTopic tool as it allows us to create “dense clusters allowing for easily interpretable topics whilst keeping important words in the topic descriptions” (Grootndorst, 2022). We performed a BERTopic modeling analysis on both the 2021 and 2023 data in order to also take into account any potential evolution over time of the topics surrounding Net Zero. 

For the year 2021, we retrieved 225 topics ranging from COP26 to 5G to blockchain. Due to the sheer amount of topics, we analyzed more in depth the first 20, showing their top 10 words and whose topic word scores are displayed in Figure 9 below. 

![Figure 9](https://github.com/DDPSscipo/Civica_Netzero/assets/169551434/6a1be654-4bad-41a5-8473-dbe300900bce)

Figure 9: Topic word scores for the 2021 period 

The first 20 topics seem to be pretty adherent to the core of the concept of net zero and the relevance of the UK NetZero Strategy. Most of the words have to do with energy, green investments, COP26 (which was happening in Glasgow, UK), climate-related events, and greenhouse emissions. It is noteworthy to address topic 17, which is the one that deviates most from Net Zero, concentrating on “referendum” and “election”. Arguably, we could interpret this outlier in the context of the entry into force of the first effects of the 2016 Brexit referendum. In fact, the Northern Ireland Protocol was enforced in early 2021, as was the end of the free movement of people, goods and services between the UK and the EU. Another less convincing explanation could be linked to promises that the Scottish National Party had made regarding a future referendum for Scotland to leave the UK and rejoin the EU. Nevertheless, the mediatic relevance of these electoral promises remains limited. 

The visualization of these topics also appears unintelligible, as shown by Figure 10. We can nonetheless remark that the cluster formed by all 225 topics is rather dense, possibly indicating an overall resonance across topics. This confirms the results from Figure 9.

![Figure 10](https://github.com/DDPSscipo/Civica_Netzero/assets/169551434/ff5ef517-1242-44ea-9f3a-30db4f7e17b5)

Figure 10: Documents and topic for the period 2021

In order to render the visualization more insightful, we decided to apply a “min_cluster_size” parameter to single out the most relevant topics. The minimum cluster size was set to 100. The topics that emerged are 10. The results of this action are shown in Figures 11 and 12. 


![Figure 11](https://github.com/DDPSscipo/Civica_Netzero/assets/169551434/10a46314-1eb2-4fb0-af13-f7a44487ae60)

Figure 12: Documents and topics for the 2021 period after applying the min_cluster_size parameter 

Selecting only topics with a cluster bigger than 100 confirmed the patterns present in the previous top 20 topics. The emerging clusters deal with climate, energy, strategy and agriculture. It is, however, striking to notice in the clusters’ visualization (Figure 12) the number of light gray dots. Evidently, the relative majority of Tweets fall under the “outlier category” (in the BERTopic modeling analysis classified in the “Topic -1” category). This trend has been present across all our topic modeling analysis and will be addressed in depth in our later Limitations section. Overall, for the 2021 period there is no significant element hinting at a “bipartisan culture war” stemming around the Net Zero debate on Twitter. Thus, Hypothesis 2 does not seem to hold when analyzing the Twitter discourse from 2021. 

Nevertheless, for the year 2023, the public debate has evolved in a different direction. Out of the 179 emerged topics, the top 20 topic word scores seem to cover a much broader spectrum of socio-political issues, as shown in Figure 13. 

![FIGURE 13](https://github.com/DDPSscipo/Civica_Netzero/assets/169551434/1f3cc709-6673-4c26-aa8d-b293905678e1)

Figure 13: Topic word scores for the 2023 period


Already in Topic 0, the fourth most significant word is “climatescam”, indicating a change of tone around Net Zero. It is also interesting to point out that variations of the name of the current Prime Minister, Rishi Sunak, are present in multiple topics, notably topic 0 and topic 12. This wouldn’t seem particularly surprising if it wasn’t for the fact that in the 2021 dataset, not a single topic (out of the top 20 analyzed in depth) hinted to then-Prime Minister Theresa May, who promoted the Net Zero Strategy at the time. Many speculations could be made in this regard and an explanation could be found in the simple tendency of Prime Minister Sunak to appear frequently in the media, attracting further media attention, whilst Prime Minister May was arguably more reserved. Another rationale could, however, be linked to an increase in the phenomenon of the personalization of politics. Political personalization can be referred to as a “process in which the political weight of the individual actor in the political process increases over time, while the centrality of the political group (i.e., political party) declines” (Rahat and Sheafer, 2007). This phenomenon has been linked to a deterioration of democratic discussion and processes, all whilst exacerbating group differences (Smolo, 2021). In this sense, this trend would fall under the category of the “culture war” hereby hypothesized. Similarly, topic 6 is composed of Twitter profiles of users who seemingly post a lot about Net Zero. These users are public figures, like Fikile Mbalula, former transport minister of South Africa, as well as organizations, like the WWF. Probably the most interesting remarks need to be made about topics 13 and 15. The two topics echo each other in the presence of words like “immigration” and “reformparty_uk”. Topic 13 further specialized in “conservative/s” and “voting” issues”, whilst topic 15 pushes it further to include “migration” and “illegal”, possibly related, and “homeless”. To contextualize, Reform UK, whose president is Nigel Farage, is a eurosceptic, populist and sovranist party that advocated for Brexit, expelling immigrants from the country, refusing the scientific validation of vaccines during the COVID-19 pandemic, and, lately, has been trying to tear down net zero carbon emissions efforts. The presence of immigration and homelessness-related terms hints to the presence of that “bipartisan culture war” mobilization around net zero. Furthermore, the presence of these terms in 2023 and not in 2021 also suggest that the Twitter debate around net zero has not only shifted in terms of discussion topics but has in fact grown more partisan and radical over the past few years, presenting new leads of interpretation. 

We decided to apply the “min_cluster_size” parameter for the 2023 data as well. The threshold of the cluster size was finalized after multiple attempts as most topics appeared to have a very low count of clusters. For this reason, we set it to >30. Four topics emerged, and in this case the outlier issue (topic -1) did not arise in a significant manner (count = 68). 

![Figure14](https://github.com/DDPSscipo/Civica_Netzero/assets/169551434/89e05a79-ab0e-4cca-ab0b-8a4d97d7b280)

Figure 14: Documents and topics for the 2023 period after applying the min_cluster_size parameter 

Almost the entirety of the observations were grouped under Topic 0 with a count of 7093 out of 7342. All the topics retrieved are closely adherent to net zero, as they tackle climate, oil, energy, efficiency, and gas broadly. What the visualization in Figure 14 brings up is how much topic 0 is prevalent, how not “clustered” it is for a topic, as it spreads vastly. The other topics almost seem irrelevant. This outlook does not allow us to follow up on those arguments related to the partial validity of Hypothesis 2 in the previous paragraph. We could believe that the “more polarized” Tweets are contained in topic 0, hence that their number was so small that they were “absorbed” by a broader category. This could mean that Tweets belonging to a culture war are not of significant number to determine the broader conversation around Net Zero on Twitter. Thus, Hypothesis 2 seems to hold very limited validity.

### Network analysis
#### I. Co-hashtag Network

#### Method
The co-hashtag network is undirected. Each node is a hashtag, and each edge represents the co-existing relation between two hashtags in one tweet. We filtered out the hashtags we used for the query (#NetZero and #netzero) because they appear in every tweet; This allows the other most commonly used hashtags to stand out. The networks use ForceAtlas2 algorithm in Gephi, preventing overlap and having a scale of 200 to make the graph more scattered for better readability. The data is filtered by “giant component” criteria. The color and size of the nodes are decided by their weight, i.e., frequency to be co-hashtaged with other nodes. Nodes with higher weight are bigger and are presented in a darker green color.

#### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to see the hashtags most commonly brought up along with #NetZero, and to see the evolution of them from 2021 to 2023.

#### Results
First of all, the co-hashtag network is much more centralized in 2021 because of the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP 26) that happened in Glasgow, UK. However, besides the special event #COP26 and #UK, the most common hashtags in both 2021 and 2023 related to the climate, energy, and sustainability. These results are coherent to the findings of the Topic Modeling section, reinforcing our inability to fully validate Hypothesis 2.

#### II. User Interaction Network

#### Method
The user interaction network is directed. Each node is a user, and each edge represents a relation of one user being quoted or mentioned by another user. The networks use ForceAtlas2 algorithm in Gephi, preventing overlap and having a scale of 200 to make the graph more scattered for better readability. The data is filtered by “giant component” criteria, and the degree range is set to start from 1 to exclude the users that do not have any interactions with others. The sizes of the nodes represent the level of influence of the user, and are decided by their in-degree, i.e., the number of edges coming into a vertex in a directed graph. Nodes with higher in-degree are bigger. The colors of the nodes are decided by their communities, i.e., sets of nodes that are more densely linked among each other than with nodes in other communities.

#### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to see the influential accounts on Twitter regarding Net Zero policy and the evolution of influence landscape from 2021 to 2023.

#### Results
In 2021, most of the “influencers” were official accounts or people heavily involved in official business. Three of the four communities (pink, blue, green) detected were led by either NGOs’ or other organizations’ Twitter accounts. The other note-worthy community (gray), which is relatively far-away from the central interactions, was led by several individuals that, according to their profiles, generally made it their objective to debunk climate change deniers. Within all four of the communities, the general attitude towards Net Zero policy was positive and supportive.

![interaction_2021](https://github.com/DDPSscipo/Civica_Netzero/assets/114085950/a09ddf6e-83d7-4779-8a55-9679520dc926)

Figure 17: User Interaction Network, 2021

In 2023, however, the spotlight on the stage shifted. As shown in the Figure 18 below, official accounts that advocated for Net Zero policy heavily decreased in their influence in 2023. On the contrary, two communities (pink and blue) led by individual accounts that stood on the opposition side arose in the picture. From their profiles, bios, and Tweets on Net Zero and other environmental topics, the representatives of both communities (pink and blue) either did not approve of the UK Net Zero policy itself, or did not believe in the climate crisis at all. Some of the accounts demonstrated an evident political inclination towards conservatism. From the existing evidence, we do not have an explanation as to why these people with similar profiles are separated into two communities that closely interact within themselves.

An interesting finding is that none of the 12 most influential opposers from the pink and blue communities in 2023 network can be found in the 2021 data. It is possible that their Tweets were simply not covered in data collection. However, given the amount of Tweets we managed to scrape, it’s also highly likely that they only started to voice against the policy afterwards.

<img width="788" alt="interaction_2023" src="https://github.com/DDPSscipo/Civica_Netzero/assets/114085950/25414cbc-7fd1-4f46-9fbd-797787421b28">

Figure 18: User Interaction Network, 2023

The comparison of User Interaction Networks of 2021 and 2023 shows that the discourse around Net Zero on Twitter had a significant shift in influence landscape: from mainly being led by official accounts with a generally supportive attitude towards the policy in 2021 to mainly being led by individuals who opposed it. Combined with the conservative political stance shown by some of the individuals and that these opposers were only active on this particular issue on Twitter in 2023 and not 2021, this analysis provides some support for Hypothesis 2. It is possible that discussion surrounding Net Zero has been mobilized, at least to some extent, on Twitter in the context of bipartisan culture wars.

The opinion leaders’ shift from 2021 to 2023 also supports our Hypothesis 3, as the increased participation of individual accounts (rather than heavier participation by official accounts, as seen in 2021) demonstrates an increased public interest in the net zero concept.

## Limitations
As previously mentioned, there was an issue with collecting Tweets via Zeeschuimer for six days within the intended dataset. The total number of Tweets captured mentioning “net zero” and “uk” are thus a slight undercount over two time-periods. Despite this limitation, because of the significant number of Tweets (nearly 16,000) over six months, the omission of a small number of days worth of Tweets likely would not skew the results. Ideally, we would have incorporated these dates into our dataset, which would have corrected the limitation; however, we were unable to do so given that our asynchronous data analyses were already underway.

Another limitation relating to data collection concerns the terminology and general news surrounding Net Zero. There are other geographical locations in which “net zero” is used; for example, Australia’s decarbonization policy is also called Net Zero. Utilizing broad search terms (even with specifying that Tweets needed to mention “uk”) likely captured some non-relevant data, though it is hard to determine if this would have had a major impact on topics discussed in relation to Net Zero.  

A third limitation for data collection is the rate limits on The Guardian’s API, which made it difficult to collect all of our news data in one day.

As noted in our brief discussion of sentiment analysis, using such an approach to understand the attitudes of the Net Zero discussion on Twitter largely failed. The RoBERTa model did not recognize positive or negative sentiments across Tweets, only recognizing a negligible number of Tweets as positive or negative. Even from briefly reviewing a handful of random Tweets, we can see that there were strong feelings expressed by people online, and that Net Zero was being associated with a host of topics, including the environment but also broader socio-political topics. The incompatibility of these results may be because the content and references within the Tweets were too subtle for RoBERTa to understand. Additionally, we did not fine tune or train the model for this analysis, which also likely contributed to the failed results. Finally, there are broader challenges when it comes to interpreting sentiment analysis results, so such an approach does not seem particularly useful for answering our research questions and hypotheses. 

Finally, with respect to topic modeling, the most considerable limitation to our analysis can be imputed to the high number of outliers in both the 2021 and 2023 datasets. Grouped together in “topic -1”, outliers often accounted for the vast majority of observations. In particular, for the 2021 period, outliers amounted to 3072 whilst the next biggest topic reached 209 Tweets. Similarly for 2023, outliers were 2854 and topic 0 had 188 Tweets. We could explain this high of a number of outliers with the complexity and nuance of the public discourse around net zero. It can be hard for BERTopic to detect the multiple interpretations that Tweets have and place them in defined categories. We have encountered a similar issue when performing the sentiment analysis, that ultimately struggle to understand the complexity of certain contributions. This issue evidently questions the validity of our results, especially those related to Hypothesis 2.

## Conclusions
<p align="justify"> 
This investigation aimed to explore and unpack the social and news media discourse about the UK’s Net Zero climate policy. It led to several fascinating findings. In our research, we observed politicians, civil society organizations/groups, and individuals engaging in commentary about Net Zero on Twitter. In 2021, official organizations and leaders dominated the conversation, which more narrowly centered on topics specifically related to climate change and the implementation of Net Zero. Two years later in 2023, we began to see new players (more private individuals), whose discourse on Net Zero was at times associated (but not overwhelmingly) with broad socio-political issues and voicing opposition to environmental policies and immigration. In traditional media, The Guardian’s coverage in some ways mirrored the engagement on Twitter – pieces were published by the newspaper during moments of critical development in both 2021 and 2023, providing narratives to the implementation or changes to Net Zero and offering a platform for opinion pieces on the policy.
<p align="justify"> 
As climate change will necessitate more aggressive policy responses, people will continue to want their voices to be heard on the topic. Individuals, politicians, and civil society groups alike share information and opinions, shaping conversation on and offline. The discourse on social media platforms like Twitter can potentially reveal trends in public interest, which can in turn bolster as well as inform the insights within traditional media.
