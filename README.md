## Introduction

April 2024 broke another record in the climate change arena. Surpassing the 1991-2020 average for the month, April 2024 was reportedly the hottest April in the last thirty years, reaching over 15°C (Mooney et al., 2024). Over the past decades citizens and decision makers have been forced to confront the visible effects of climate change on communities all around the globe. With climate change, we refer to the long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns caused by anthropogenic means. Since the Industrial Revolution, the exponential increase in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions has led to the trapping of the sun’s heat in the atmosphere, generating a +2°C rise compared to pre-industrial levels. Consequences of this increase in temperatures range from the melting of arctic ice to a growth in weather-related catastrophes like floods, storms and droughts. To tackle the effects of climate change, governments globally have started putting forward legislation and policies at the local and international levels. From the United Nations Framework Conference on Climate Change (UNFCCC) to the Kyoto Protocol to the Paris Agreement, curbing GHG emissions seems to be at the top of the climate agenda. In this perspective, we were interested in analyzing the best practices in the realm of climate policies. Notably, the UK’s 2021 Net Zero Strategy represents the first piece of legislation by a major economy to commit to reaching net zero GHG emissions by 2050. Passed by a conservative government, led by then-Prime Minister Theresa May, the policy is innovative in its sectoral approach, prioritizing strategic sectors like transport, agriculture, and industry at large. Furthermore, the carbon pricing mechanisms would aim to foster energy efficiency measures and attract investments on low-carbon technologies. Due to its ambitiousness, the Strategy has attracted a lot of media and public attention, at times critical. For this reason, investigating how the discourse developed around it on social media and in a leading UK news outlet – namely on Twitter (now X) and The Guardian –  could provide us an insightful perspective on the response towards the climate policies we are seeing ramp up all around the world. We are going to lead our investigation by addressing **_two main research questions:_**

**RQ1:** What are the topics of focus in The Guardian’s coverage and in the public discourse on Twitter, and to what extent are these topics reflected across one another?

**RQ2:** How has traditional media coverage by The Guardian and public discourse on Twitter evolved around the UK’s Net Zero policy? 


### Hypotheses
To develop hypotheses, our team conducted an initial scan of the discourse on Twitter as well as reviewed how The Guardian framed its articles covering the Net Zero Strategy. We observed a surprising amount of Tweets relating Net Zero to broader socio-political critiques. In particular, the term seemed to be deployed in a “culture wars” context by accounts expressing right-wing views, such as opposition to both immigration and environmental protections.

As a result, we derived three hypotheses to understand the Twitter discourse and The Guardian coverage of Net Zero in the UK:

**Hypothesis 1:** Traditional media coverage by The Guardian on Net Zero mirrors an overall increase in social media interest on Twitter, whilst they may differ in focus.

**Hypothesis 2:** Net Zero has often been mobilized on social media in the context of bipartisan culture wars.

**Hypothesis 3:** There is a mutual correlation between the introduction and implementation of the Net Zero Strategy and an increased public interest in the “net zero” concept over the last several years.
