## Introduction

April 2024 broke another record in the climate change arena. Surpassing the 1991-2020 average for the month, April 2024 was reportedly the hottest April in the last thirty years, reaching over 15°C (Mooney et al., 2024). Over the past decades citizens and decision makers have been forced to confront the visible effects of climate change on communities all around the globe. With climate change, we refer to the long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns caused by anthropogenic means. Since the Industrial Revolution, the exponential increase in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions has led to the trapping of the sun’s heat in the atmosphere, generating a +2°C rise compared to pre-industrial levels. Consequences of this increase in temperatures range from the melting of arctic ice to a growth in weather-related catastrophes like floods, storms and droughts. To tackle the effects of climate change, governments globally have started putting forward legislation and policies at the local and international levels. From the United Nations Framework Conference on Climate Change (UNFCCC) to the Kyoto Protocol to the Paris Agreement, curbing GHG emissions seems to be at the top of the climate agenda. In this perspective, we were interested in analyzing the best practices in the realm of climate policies. Notably, the UK’s 2021 Net Zero Strategy represents the first piece of legislation by a major economy to commit to reaching net zero GHG emissions by 2050. Passed by a conservative government, led by then-Prime Minister Theresa May, the policy is innovative in its sectoral approach, prioritizing strategic sectors like transport, agriculture, and industry at large. Furthermore, the carbon pricing mechanisms would aim to foster energy efficiency measures and attract investments on low-carbon technologies. Due to its ambitiousness, the Strategy has attracted a lot of media and public attention, at times critical. For this reason, investigating how the discourse developed around it on social media and in a leading UK news outlet – namely on Twitter (now X) and The Guardian –  could provide us an insightful perspective on the response towards the climate policies we are seeing ramp up all around the world. We are going to lead our investigation by addressing **_two main research questions:_**

**RQ1:** What are the topics of focus in The Guardian’s coverage and in the public discourse on Twitter, and to what extent are these topics reflected across one another?

**RQ2:** How has traditional media coverage by The Guardian and public discourse on Twitter evolved around the UK’s Net Zero policy? 


### Hypotheses
To develop hypotheses, our team conducted an initial scan of the discourse on Twitter as well as reviewed how The Guardian framed its articles covering the Net Zero Strategy. We observed a surprising amount of Tweets relating Net Zero to broader socio-political critiques. In particular, the term seemed to be deployed in a “culture wars” context by accounts expressing right-wing views, such as opposition to both immigration and environmental protections.

As a result, we derived three hypotheses to understand the Twitter discourse and The Guardian coverage of Net Zero in the UK:

**Hypothesis 1:** Traditional media coverage by The Guardian on Net Zero mirrors an overall increase in social media interest on Twitter, whilst they may differ in focus.

**Hypothesis 2:** Net Zero has often been mobilized on social media in the context of bipartisan culture wars.

**Hypothesis 3:** There is a mutual correlation between the introduction and implementation of the Net Zero Strategy and an increased public interest in the “net zero” concept over the last several years.

## Overview: The Implementation of Net Zero

### The Net Zero Strategy in the UK
The journey towards achieving net zero emissions has become a global imperative as nations grapple with the challenges posed by climate change. The Net Zero commitment embraced by several nations is a pledge aimed at minimizing carbon emissions to a level where only a minimal amount of residual emissions remains, which can either be safely absorbed by the environment or captured through the use of green technologies(UN). The Net Zero policy adopted by the UK aims to reduce carbon emissions by 50% and 75% by 2032 and 2037, respectively, and to reach net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 (Department of Energy Security & Net Zero, 2023). In order to reach net zero by 2050, the UK Government has implemented a series of policies outlined in two strategy documents: the original Net Zero Strategy: Build Back Greener (2021) and Powering Up Britain: Net Zero Growth Plan (2023) (Burnett, Edwards, Watson, 2023).

In October 2021, the UK government published Net Zero Strategy: Build Back Greener. The UK seeks to reduce its current levels of emissions through five-year carbon budgets outlined in the Climate Change Act. The Climate Change Act, enacted in 2008, serves to achieve and lower carbon emissions targets by 2050. It establishes a framework for carbon budgeting and establishes a committee to aid in achieving this objective (UK Legislation, 2008). This document presents policies and proposals to measure and maintain progress towards upcoming carbon budgets, aligning with the ambitious visions for a decarbonized economy by 2050.

In June 2022, the environmental organizations Friends of the Earth, ClientEarth, Good Law Project, as well as environmental campaigner Jo Wheatley, took the UK government to court over its 2021 Net Zero strategy. The groups argued that the government’s policies would not reduce emissions enough to meet the carbon budgets outlined in the Climate Change Act of 2008. In July, the UK High Court of Justice handed down its judgment. The ruling deemed the government’s initial plan to be inadequate and ordered the government to outline exactly how its net zero policies would achieve emissions targets, and to publish a revised Net Zero strategy (Client Earth, 2022; Gayle, 2022).

In March 2023, following the Court’s decision, the UK government published Powering Up Britain: Net Zero Growth Plan, a comprehensive strategy aimed at achieving net zero emissions while promoting economic growth. It addresses recommendations from an independent review of Net Zero. The revised plan focuses on driving investment into green industries like offshore wind, carbon capture, and nuclear energy (Department for Energy Security & Net Zero, 2023).
Our interest in examining the UK’s Net Zero policy within a specific timeframe stems from its evolving significance in both traditional media and online discourses.

## Literature Review

### Social media discourse and agenda setting
The importance of mass media (radio, television, printed press) in shaping political discourse has been largely discussed. The concept of the agenda setting function of mass media, as proposed by McCombs and Shaw (1971) and Gilardi et al. (2022), refers to the traditional media's power to determine the subjects discussed politically, that is to say, to set the political agenda. As political scientist Bernard C. Cohen explains, the press “‘may not be successful much of the time in telling people what to think, but it is stunningly successful in telling its readers what to think about’” (Cohen cited in McCombs & Shaw, 1971, p. 177).

The spread of the Internet and the popularity of social media has revolutionized the sources through which the public remains informed about political information. Social media has also made it possible to interact directly with journalists, politicians, and other political actors (Chu & Fletcher, 2014). Gilardi et. al (2022) found that social media has changed political agenda setting dynamics in three main ways. Firstly, social media has emerged as a meaningful channel for political communication. Secondly, social media broadens the range and diversity of actors who can influence the agenda. Thirdly, social media can be used by political actors to attract traditional media attention, and gain a wider audience.

Chu & Fletcher (2014) for instance, found evidence of agenda setting led by Twitter (now X) activity. In one example, Canadian news networks were found to have given more coverage to the topic of the federal long-gun registry the day after a peak in activity related to the subject on social media. The influence of Twitter and traditional mass media can go both ways, and greatly varies according to the topic. It is also important to keep in mind that Twitter has a particular type of audience (mostly highly educated, mainly young users).


## Methodology 

### Data collection
Our broad approach to data collection included gathering data for two sources before delving into our analysis. Specifically, we collected data in the form of Tweets from the social media platform Twitter and in the form of articles from The Guardian’s API. There were two three-month periods of interest – September 1 through November 30, 2021, and September 1 to November 30, 2023 – selected to investigate whether and how the discourse and news coverage may have changed over time. We decided to start with the month immediately before and after the Net Zero policy’s implementation in October 2021 and then repeated the same three selected months two years later in 2023. 

For Twitter, we scraped Tweets by month that included the keywords “net zero” and “uk” utilizing the Firefox extensions Zeeschuimer and FoxScroller. We limited captured Tweets to being written in English and with a minimum of one like. The keyword search is included below (with the initial month of September 2021 for demonstrative purposes): 

_("net zero" OR "netzero") AND "uk" min_faves:1 lang:en until:2021-09-30 since:2021-09-01_

We utilized the VPN Mullvad and set the location to London, England. In total, we collected 15,998 Tweets over the two three-month periods in 2021 and 2023, with 8,656 Tweets during the 2021 period and 7,342 during the 2023 period. During data collection, we encountered an error while scraping Twitter data – Tweets from the final date of each month during both periods (September 30, 2021; October 31, 2021; November 30, 2021; September 30, 2023; October 31, 2023; and November 30, 2023) were not collected by Zeeschuimer despite search terms requesting data through the end of the month. This omission is thus one important limitation that we will discuss in greater depth in the Limitations section of the report. We were unable to add the missing dates’ Tweets into our dataset for analysis because of time constraints and for the fact that various team members had already started their separate analyses. 

We utilized The Guardian’s API to gather all news pieces concerning Net Zero from September 2021, to February 2024, amassing over 1,000 articles. For the purpose of our analyses, we focused on articles from September 2021 through November 2021 and September 2023 through November 2023. Subsequently, we manually sifted through this dataset to isolate articles specifically addressing the implementation of Net Zero in the UK, leaving 156 articles for the entire 2021-2024 period. (With respect to the two periods of interest, we collected 26 articles for September - November 2021, and 36 during the same window in 2023.) Additionally, keyword filters such as "net zero" and "UK" were applied to aid in this filtering process, recognizing that the term "Net Zero'' is not exclusive to the UK, as Australia’s carbon reduction initiatives utilize the same language.

### Data cleaning
We used Python to clean the Twitter data. For the accuracy and convenience of our analysis, we removed potentially repetitive data points, and handpicked useful fields (user ID, username, creation date, content, hashtags, etc.) from the original ndjson data to include in the csv format. We also generated nodes and edges data for network analysis with software Gephi.

### Approach to data analysis
To conduct the descriptive analysis for the data from Twitter and The Guardian, our team explored four different methods of data analysis: descriptive analysis and sentiment analysis for both Twitter and The Guardian datasets, and topic modeling and network analysis utilizing Twitter data. Further details on these approaches are included in the Results and Discussion section.

We used Python for our code, which was developed and aided by various online resources and examples, including ChatGPT. We also used Gephi for data visualization.

## Results and Discussion

### Descriptive analysis: Twitter 
We produced two time-series graphs to explore the number of Tweets throughout the 2021 and 2023 time periods.

![Figure 1](https://github.com/DDPSscipo/Civica_Netzero/assets/169551434/95d16e47-9dbe-4440-9daf-4d9f6ff8f947)


## Limitations
As previously mentioned, there was an issue with collecting Tweets via Zeeschuimer for six days within the intended dataset. The total number of Tweets captured mentioning “net zero” and “uk” are thus a slight undercount over two time-periods. Despite this limitation, because of the significant number of Tweets (nearly 16,000) over six months, the omission of a small number of days worth of Tweets likely would not skew the results. Ideally, we would have incorporated these dates into our dataset, which would have corrected the limitation; however, we were unable to do so given that our asynchronous data analyses were already underway.

Another limitation relating to data collection concerns the terminology and general news surrounding Net Zero. There are other geographical locations in which “net zero” is used; for example, Australia’s decarbonization policy is also called Net Zero. Utilizing broad search terms (even with specifying that Tweets needed to mention “uk”) likely captured some non-relevant data, though it is hard to determine if this would have had a major impact on topics discussed in relation to Net Zero.  

A third limitation for data collection is the rate limits on The Guardian’s API, which made it difficult to collect all of our news data in one day.

As noted in our brief discussion of sentiment analysis, using such an approach to understand the attitudes of the Net Zero discussion on Twitter largely failed. The RoBERTa model did not recognize positive or negative sentiments across Tweets, only recognizing a negligible number of Tweets as positive or negative. Even from briefly reviewing a handful of random Tweets, we can see that there were strong feelings expressed by people online, and that Net Zero was being associated with a host of topics, including the environment but also broader socio-political topics. The incompatibility of these results may be because the content and references within the Tweets were too subtle for RoBERTa to understand. Additionally, we did not fine tune or train the model for this analysis, which also likely contributed to the failed results. Finally, there are broader challenges when it comes to interpreting sentiment analysis results, so such an approach does not seem particularly useful for answering our research questions and hypotheses. 

Finally, with respect to topic modeling, the most considerable limitation to our analysis can be imputed to the high number of outliers in both the 2021 and 2023 datasets. Grouped together in “topic -1”, outliers often accounted for the vast majority of observations. In particular, for the 2021 period, outliers amounted to 3072 whilst the next biggest topic reached 209 Tweets. Similarly for 2023, outliers were 2854 and topic 0 had 188 Tweets. We could explain this high of a number of outliers with the complexity and nuance of the public discourse around net zero. It can be hard for BERTopic to detect the multiple interpretations that Tweets have and place them in defined categories. We have encountered a similar issue when performing the sentiment analysis, that ultimately struggle to understand the complexity of certain contributions. This issue evidently questions the validity of our results, especially those related to Hypothesis 2. 

## Conclusions
This investigation aimed to explore and unpack the social and news media discourse about the UK’s Net Zero climate policy. It led to several fascinating findings. In our research, we observed politicians, civil society organizations/groups, and individuals engaging in commentary about Net Zero on Twitter. In 2021, official organizations and leaders dominated the conversation, which more narrowly centered on topics specifically related to climate change and the implementation of Net Zero. Two years later in 2023, we began to see new players (more private individuals), whose discourse on Net Zero was at times associated (but not overwhelmingly) with broad socio-political issues and voicing opposition to environmental policies and immigration. In traditional media, The Guardian’s coverage in some ways mirrored the engagement on Twitter – pieces were published by the newspaper during moments of critical development in both 2021 and 2023, providing narratives to the implementation or changes to Net Zero and offering a platform for opinion pieces on the policy.
As climate change will necessitate more aggressive policy responses, people will continue to want their voices to be heard on the topic. Individuals, politicians, and civil society groups alike share information and opinions, shaping conversation on and offline. The discourse on social media platforms like Twitter can potentially reveal trends in public interest, which can in turn bolster as well as inform the insights within traditional media.
